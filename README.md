# Nike_Shoe_Color_Numbers

We will write a program that looks at the first 60 Men's Shoes available on the Nike website and...
* Gives the title of all shoes that have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, or 8 colors
* Gives the number of colors available for a shoe type
******
Obstacles:
* Due to Nike's infinite scrolling feature, the URL only retrieves the first 60 pairs of shoes. The URL for the hidden 'pages' that contain the remaining pairs of shoes are hidden from the HTML
